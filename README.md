# RestoFlow front-end App

This is a React.js front-end application built with TypeScript, hosted on Firebase, utilizing Axios for data fetching, styled using Tailwind CSS, and set up with ESLint and Vite for development.
App is designed to manage orders and tables in a restaurant.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

### 1. Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git https://github.com/selyami-angelov/restoflow-web.git
```

### 2. Install Packages

Navigate to the project folder and install the required packages using npm:

```bash
cd your-repo
npm install
```

### 2. Adjust API Endpoint

If you want to point to the hosted API, you can use the following endpoint:

```
https://resto-flow-api.azurewebsites.net/api
```

If you have the API project running locally, you can use the local endpoint:

```
http://localhost:port/api
```

> Note: Replace 'port' with the actual port number of your API. For example, if your API is running on port 5000, the API endpoint would be 'http://localhost:5000/api'.

### 3. Run the Development Server

To run the app in development mode using Vite, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Firebase. You can access the public hosted version of the app at [Restaurant Flow App](https://resto-flow-web.web.app/).
